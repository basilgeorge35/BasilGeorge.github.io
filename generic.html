								<p>I recently completed my MSc in Data Science, graduating in the top 10% of my class with Distinction. Throughout my studies, I built a strong foundation in data analysis, visualization, machine learning, big data, and statistics. I also honed my skills in Python, SQL, Power BI, and other tools. I'm excited to put these into practice in a data role. </p>
								<p>Before my Master's, I worked at Wipro, where I worked with financial clients like Lloyds Bank and Charles Schwab, mainly focusing on IT and cybersecurity. That experience gave me valuable problem-solving skills, a deep understanding of financial operations, and exposure to data driven decision making, skills that easily transfer into the world of data science. </p>
								<p>The data field is still in its evolution phase. As someone who enjoys learning new technologies and challenging himself, Iâ€™ve always wanted to be a part of that evolution. That curiosity is what led me to leave my IT role and dive deep into data science. Now, with a mix of technical knowledge and real-world experience, I'm eager to contribute to a team where I can apply them and grow my skills. </p>
								<p>I'm open to a variety of opportunities, including internships, contract, and permanent roles. I'm also happy to relocate anywhere in the UK for the right opportunity. </p>
								<p>I'd love the opportunity to connect and discuss how I can be a useful part of your team. Looking forward to hearing from you!</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>Best,<br />
								Basil George
